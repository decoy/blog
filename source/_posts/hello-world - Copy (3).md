Ghost has an incredibly simple concept for writing. You write in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown) on the left, and you see an immediate preview of exactly what your post will look like in rendered HTML on the right.

###The Benefits Are Obvious!

* Never stop writing, format on the fly
* No messing around with *buttons* everywhere
* No writing repetitive HTML markup
* Mobile friendly

It's a wonderful solution to a problem which bloggers have faced for many years now.

> Applying a multitude of formatting styles, with very little effort, and seeing those styles rendered exactly as they will appear on the website.

Give it a try! Start typing in the `Markdown` box. It's easy

```c#
//colors used for landscapes kinda
var LANDSCAPE_COLORS = {
    Plains: "green",
    Desert: "lightgoldenrodyellow",
    FreshWater: "lightblue",
    Hills: "darkgreen",
    Mountains: "gray",
    Ocean: "darkblue",
    Volcanic: "darkgray"
};
```
